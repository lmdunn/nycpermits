# Parks
I looked at how the boroughs compare to each other. I ranked the boroughs by mean distance to closest park. I also ranked them by percent of city park, by area and by perimeter. I consider perimeter the better metric because the ability to build near a park is a function of how much perimeter is available to build in. Staten Island illustrates this well: it has the second most park by area but the least by perimeter, suggesting it has fewer but larger parks. 

It's worth noting that malls in the median of roads (i.e. the Broadway Mall running up Broadway) are included here, and may distort perimeters somewhat. This is an area for further exploration.

![Borough Park Ranks](/images/borough_parks_rank.png "The Boroughs By Park Rank")

Focusing on the metric of park perimeter rank, there are two boroughs with closest park ranks that are more than one rank different than its park perimiter rank. Staten Island ranks 5 in park perimeter rank but 2 in the mean
